Ethanon Engine's Sublime plugin 4 LINUX
===========================

Through this modified sublime text plugin is possible to develop your Ethanon Engine's projects on Linux. (does not compile for Linux, only generates a new updated game.bin).

* What's my point ?
  * Being capable of develop for Android and Windows from Linux. The game.bin bytecode generated by Ethanon is universal, just changing their nomenclature (example: android_game.bin, ios_game.bin). (http://doc.ethanonengine.com/manual/83)
